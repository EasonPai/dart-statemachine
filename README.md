============

A simple, but generic state machine framework for Dart.

Continuous build results are available from [Jenkins](http://jenkins.lukas-renggli.ch/view/Dart/job/StateMachineDart/).
An introductionary tutorial is part of the [class documentation](http://jenkins.lukas-renggli.ch/view/Dart/job/StateMachineDart/javadoc/statemachine.html).

This code was inspired by work of Vassily Boykov on his [Smalltalk Announcement framework](http://www.cincomsmalltalk.com/userblogs/vbykov/blogView?searchCategory=Announcements%20Framework).
