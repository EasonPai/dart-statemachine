Continuous build results are available from [Jenkins](http://jenkins.lukas-renggli.ch/job/dart-statemachine/).
An introductionary tutorial is part of the [class documentation](http://jenkins.lukas-renggli.ch/view/dart-statemachine/javadoc/statemachine.html).

This code was inspired by work of Vassily Boykov on his [Smalltalk Announcement framework](http://www.cincomsmalltalk.com/userblogs/vbykov/blogView?searchCategory=Announcements%20Framework).
